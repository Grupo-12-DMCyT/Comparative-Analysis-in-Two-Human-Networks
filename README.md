## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

This project explores the structural properties of two real-world human contact networks with contrasting organizational logics:

- **Email-EU**: an institutional and open network based on email communications within a European research organization.
- **Terrorist**: a covert and compartmentalized network based on reconstructed contacts between individuals involved in the 2004 Madrid train bombings.

We applied graph theory metrics to compare their **degree distributions**, **centralities**, **robustness**, and **community structures**, and contrasted both against synthetic graph models:  
- ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyi (ER)  
- Wattsâ€“Strogatz (WS)  
- BarabÃ¡siâ€“Albert (BA)  
- Holmeâ€“Kim (HK)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Characterize and compare the topologies of both networks.
- Analyze node centralities: degree and betweenness.
- Assess robustness under random and targeted node removals.
- Detect communities using Louvain and Girvanâ€“Newman algorithms.
- Compare with classical synthetic graph models.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

- Data processing and analysis were conducted in Python using the NetworkX library.
- Real datasets were adjusted (e.g., using the largest connected component).
- Prototypes were generated with matching size and density.
- Metrics analyzed:
  - Degree distribution
  - Clustering coefficient
  - Average shortest path length
  - Global efficiency
  - Centrality measures
  - Community detection and modularity

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- Both networks exhibit **small-world properties**.
- **Email-EU**: higher degree dispersion and greater robustness.
- **Terrorist**: denser, more vulnerable to targeted attacks, reflects compartmentalization.
- Both networks show high modularity but differ in community segmentation.
- No single synthetic model fully captures the complexity of the real networks.
